# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to OpenCalc! We're thrilled you're interested in contributing and are excited to have you as part of our community. Below are the guidelines that we ask you to follow so that we can have a productive and collaborative environment.

## Code of Conduct
Before contributing, please read our Code of Conduct, which can be found [here](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs
Before creating bug reports, please check [the issue tracker](https://github.com/B-IT-Projects-GmbH/open-calc/issues) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one using our bug report template.

### Suggesting Enhancements
Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. If it does, proceed with opening an issue using our feature request template. If you're unsure, you're welcome to open an issue to discuss it or contact a maintainer directly.

### Pull Requests
Good pull requests —patches, improvements, new features, bug fixes or vulnerability patches— are a great help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

**Getting Started:**
1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`.
   - If you're asking yourself how to name your branch appropriately, [use this guide](https://gist.github.com/digitaljhelms/4287848).
4. Make your changes, add tests for your code if necessary, and ensure the tests all pass.
5. Push your branch to your fork on GitHub: `git push origin my-new-feature`.
6. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.
